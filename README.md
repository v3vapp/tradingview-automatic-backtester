## How does it work?  
  
Since there is no API for TradingView, this system manipulates the TradingView website by selenium.  
Post strategy, parameter ranges, time-frames, deep-history mode, and so on to this app which has dockerized and deployed via REST API.  
This app automatically starts driving TradingView and keeps backtesting for you.  
Once backtest has been done, this app automatically picks up the best parameter, and then it restarts backtesting around the best result. 
In the end, this app provides you with the best of the BEST parameter.  
   
That's all I remember...  
  
## History  
  
This is my first application ever built. It was in mid-2022.    
    
I see so many mistakes, but I feel like keeping them the way it is.   
Because creating this app was one of the biggest challenges and also the most painful days in my life before 25.  
Since I had little experience with python, I spent a couple of months building this app.   
It took me days to install python and a week to understand and activate the virtual environment.   
    
In the future, I feel like want to look back at bad codes and feel a bit of nostalgia.   
Also as my milestone.
